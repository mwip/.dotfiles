** Getting started

  as described [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dotfiles#Tracking_dotfiles_directly_with_Git][in this Arch-Wiki page]], I use a bare git repository to track my configuration and dotfiles. 
  
  To use them clone this repository ...

  #+begin_src shell
  git clone --bare https://github.com/mwip/.dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
  #+end_src

  ... and add an alias that serves this specific bare repo:

  #+begin_src shell
  alias dotfiles='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME'
  #+end_src

  Further, prevent git from showing all untracked files in your home directory: 

  #+begin_src shell
  dotfiles config status.showUntrackedFiles no
  #+end_src

** Revert your current configuration

   *Please be careful!* This will delete your current configuration!
   
   After cloning the repo, you will see that the files have been deleted. Therefore, you need to revert the files. You can do that like this: 

   #+begin_src shell
   dotfiles restore --staged .zshrc
   dotfiles diff .zshrc # will show you the differences between your current file and this configuration
   dotfiles restore .zshrc
   #+end_src
   

** Enjoy!
